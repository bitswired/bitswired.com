## üß† ML Tip: Follow the Data Centric approach when possible

There are two main approaches when you develop machine learning solutions:

- **Model centric**: the **data is locked**, you improve the models to get
  better results
- **Data centric**: the **model is locked**, you improve the data to get better
  results.

As research progresses, the state of the art gets amazingly good in a multitude
of tasks. Developing your own model, at your own cost brings diminishing rewards
...

I‚Äôm the first tempted to build model from scratch, because it‚Äôs fun and
educationally important.

However, to deliver the highest value, in the shortest time span, it‚Äôs not a
great approach.

How much time did it take for entire teams to build these SOTA models? Is it
likely I will beat them in a short amount of time? Do I have the computing
resources and enough data to train a huge model from scratch?

Realistically not (in many cases).

Let‚Äôs introduce another framework:

1. Find a few model candidates, the best according to the research for your task
2. Fix these models: you won‚Äôt spend much time modeling
3. Improve the data quality, and/or gather more high-quality data
4. Train or fine-tune the models and monitor performances
5. Repeat steps 3 to 5 many times to improve the results

In this framework the focus is on **data**. You spend much less time modeling,
and much more cleaning, labeling, gathering and preparing data.

You leverage the best models available, usually their open source implementation
(in your favorite framework), and focus your effort on data quality and
quantity.

## üåê Web Tip: Improve web vital metrics with lazy loading

Web vitals are group of metrics to measure the quality of the user experience
for web applications.

The core metrics are:

- Largest Content Paint (**LCP**): measures **loading** performance.
- First Input Delay (**FID**): measures **interactivity**.
- Cumulative Layout Shift (**CLS**): measures visual **stability**.

A good user experience happens below **2.5 seconds LCP**, **100 ms FID** and
**0.1 CLS**: these are guidelines number provided by
[Google](https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals).

If you develop a web application, you now have access to many great JavaScript
frameworks: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/),
[Angular](https://angular.io/), ... and a myriad of JavaScript libraries thanks
to npm and module bundlers. But it comes at a price ... the **size of your
application increases:**

1. Loading time suffers since the users download more JavaScript code
2. Interactivity suffers since the browser have to interpret potentially a lot
   of JS
3. Stability suffers since elements rendered at runtime might change the layout
   of the app

You might think that powerful computers and high-speed internet alleviates these
issues. However an important number of users are still on slow internet
connections like 3G and below (e.g in poor countries, ...)

A simple solution to control the web vital metrics of your app is to use **lazy
loading**.

The idea is simple, you don‚Äôt need to ship the code to render elements outside
of the application viewport: since the user doesn‚Äôt see them, you should not
spend resources on them.

The initial load time, interactivity and stability will improve, and as the user
navigates your app, you progressively load the required JS code.

Modern frameworks all supports lazy loading, start using it to improve user
experience.

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Research Paper: data2vec, A General Framework for Self-supervised Learning in Speech, Vision and Language

Self-supervised learning is a hot research topic in machine learning. Yan LeCun,
chief scientist at Meta, is convinced that it‚Äôs a key component to improve deep
learning models:

- [Facebook research article](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/self-supervised-learning-the-dark-matter-of-intelligence/)
- [YouTube podcast with Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGzMElJ11Cc)
- [Article on thenextweb.com](https://thenextweb.com/news/metas-yann-lecun-is-betting-on-self-supervised-learning-to-unlock-human-compatible-ai)

In a few words, it‚Äôs a kind of unsupervised learning where the data itself
provides supervision.

For instance you can pre-train a computer vision model on images without labels:
you mask the image randomly and train the model to predict the missing area.
Doing so you expect that the model will learn meaningful representation of the
data.

Since it simpler to gather unlabelled data, you can leverage huge dataset to
pre-train you models before you train them on the final tasks.

Data2vec is a paper about self-supervision for speech vision and language. The
core idea is to use a standard **Transformer** architecture to predict a
**latent representations of the data** from a masked input. It‚Äôs different from
usual technique which predict **modality-specific** targets such as words,
visual tokens or unit of speech.

/>

First the model encode a masked version of the training data (student mode).

Then training targets are constructed by encoding the unmasked data with the
same model but parametrized as an exponentially moving average of the model
weights (teacher mode).

This idea to use an exponentially moving average of the model weights for the
teacher comes from another paper:
[Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14294.pdf).
It‚Äôa form of self distillation.

It‚Äôs great to see more and more work in the self-supervision as it unlocks new
ways to use data, even when it‚Äôs not labelled.

## üõ†¬†Tool: HTTPie, Painless API testing and interactions

ü§ï Debugging API calls can be tedious because they can be hard to replicate and
often involve many different components.

Additionally, API calls can be time-consuming to write, and the results can be
difficult to interpret.

HTTPie is a delightful CLI HTTP client that makes interacting with web services
as human-friendly as possible.

It's perfect for:

üëâüèΩ Testing <br /> üëâüèΩ Debugging <br /> üëâüèΩ Generally getting the most out of APIs
and HTTP servers. <br />

With the `http` and `https` commands, you can easily create and send any sort of
HTTP request you need.

### DeepMind released GATO: A multimodal generalist agent

Inspired by large language models,
[DeepMind released GATO](https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent):
a generalist agent. Remarkable features: It handles many types of data: image,
text, ‚Ä¶ The same network with the same weights is used for all the tasks. It
uses the context to decide which tasks to complete.

### Cloudflare D1: The first SQL database on Cloudflare, compatible with workers

Cloudflare announced its first database product:
[D1](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-d1/).

It‚Äôs a database designed for Cloudflare Workers and built on top of SQLite.

It enhances Workers with SQL powers. Along with the other Worker services, we

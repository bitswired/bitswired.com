# Me

I am a 28 **years** old machine learning engineer based in Switzerland. I
studied at EPFL where I first got a Bachelor's degree in Computer
Science/Communication Systems, and then a Master's degree in Data Science.

I currently work at Visium, an AI startup where we build state-of-the-art
artificial intelligence solutions to empower the digital transformation of
businesses.

My main interests are in artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and web
development (back-end and front-end).

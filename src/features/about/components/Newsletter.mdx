# Newsletter

The Bitswired newsletter is a means to interact directly with you. Learning
never ends!

I'm constantly looking for cutting-edge technologies, trying new tools, and
reading papers. I will share my findings with you regularly via a curated digest
of valuable information. It is published every two weeks.

It won't be a no-reply email, so I invite you to answer to spark interesting
conversations.
